I will go through my workspace to see if I had missed someone and check the feedback report.
If i can detect the mistake, I will try to work on the project again and correct the mistakes.
If I am unable to detect the mistake or don't understand the reason i failed, I will talk to my peers and share the screen with them so that they can put me thropugh as they might have encompass similar challenges.
